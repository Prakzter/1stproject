        <p class="articlepara">Web design is more than just technical matters such as wireframes, code, and content management. It’s more than just aesthetics and looking good. It isn’t even about how you integrate the social media buttons or even slick visuals. Web design is about creating a website that aligns with an overarching strategy.<br><br>Well-designed websites  attract visitors and help your prospective customers understand the product, company, and branding through a variety of indicators, encompassing visuals, text, and interactions. That means every element of your site needs to work towards a defined goal.<br><br>For us at PageXsg, that harmonious synthesis of elements takes form through 7 stages:</p>
        <h4 class="heading-20">1. Goal identification</h4>
        <p class="articlepara">In this initial stage, the designer needs to identify the website’s end goal, usually in close collaboration with the client or other stakeholders. Questions to explore and answer in this stage of the process include:<br><br>- Who is the site for?<br>- What do they expect to find or do there?<br>- Is this website’s primary aim to inform or to sell a particular/range of products?<br>- Does the website need to clearly convey a brand’s core message, or is it part of a wider branding strategy with its own unique focus?<br>- What competitor sites, if any, exist? And how should this site be inspired by/different than those competitors?<br><br>In our honest opinion, this stage is often the most rushed through or even completely overlooked by some design agencies. <br><br>Identify one or more clear goals the site needs to fulfill, or have a summary of the expected purpose. This helps to define what content needs to be on your site and filter out content that are “clutter”, allowing the site to be easy to use. Analysing audience personas, brand attributes and their competitor&#x27;s websites would provide a plethora of material to assist in identifying the website&#x27;s intended goals.</p>
        <h4 class="heading-20">2. Scope definition</h4>
        <p class="articlepara">Once we know the site&#x27;s goals, we can define the scope of the project. I.e., what pages and features the site requires to fulfill the goal, and the timeline for building those out. <br><br>One of the most common and difficult problems plaguing web design projects is scope creep. The client sets out with one goal in mind, but this gradually expands, evolves, or changes altogether during the design process — and the next thing you know, you’re not only designing and building a website, but also a web app, emails, and push notifications. This isn’t necessarily a problem for designers, as it can often lead to more work. But if the increased expectations aren’t matched by an increase in budget or timeline, the project can rapidly become unrealistic. <br><br>Gantt Charts are useful in visualising the actual timeline of work for the project by highlighting boundaries (often depicted by the number of individual sub tasks) and achievable deadlines. You could also list out the scope of work in a contract between yourself and the designer.</p>
        <h4 class="heading-20">3. Sitemap and wireframe creation</h4>
        <p class="articlepara">You don&#x27;t build a house without a blueprint. Likewise, a website&#x27;s sitemap provides the foundation by providing a clear idea of the website’s information architecture and explains the relationships between the various pages and content elements. This relationship is called page hierarchy and its key purpose is to flesh out the need for sub menus or pages. Do note that a clear definition of scope from the previous step must be agreed upon before embarking on crafting the sitemap.<br><br>The next step is to build the wireframe. Wireframes provide a framework for storing the site’s visual design and content elements, and can help identify potential challenges and gaps with the sitemap.Although a wireframe doesn’t contain any final design elements, it does act as a guide for how the site will ultimately look. Some designers use high-fidelity tools like Photoshop or Sketch to create their wireframes or low-fidelity ones with pieces of paper. <br><br>Always start off with low-fidelity and figure out if the navigation and page structure make sense before getting the designer to work on the high-fidelity wireframes to prevent delays in the project and a huge bill after. We&#x27;ll be covering the differences between hi vs lo fidelity in another article in our resource repository.</p>
        <h4 class="heading-20">4. Content creation</h4>
        <p class="articlepara">Now that we have a bigger picture of the site in mind, we can start creating content for the individual pages, with search engine optimization in mind to help keep pages focused on a single topic. <br><br>Content engages readers and drives them to take the actions necessary to fulfill a site’s goals. This is affected by both the content itself (the writing), and how it’s presented (the typography and structural elements).<br><br>Dull, lifeless, and overlong prose rarely keeps visitors’ attention for long. Short, snappy, and intriguing content grabs them and gets them to click through to other pages. Even if your pages need a lot of content — and often, they do — properly “chunking” that content by breaking it up into short paragraphs supplemented by visuals can help it keep a light, engaging feel.<br><br>Well-written, informative, and keyword-rich content are the way to go. They are more easily picked up by search engines, all of which helps to make the site easier to find. The design process should focus on designing websites around SEO. Keywords to be ranked should be placed in the title tag — the closer to the beginning, the better. Keywords should also appear in the H1 tag, meta description, and body content.<br><br>The bulk of the content is typically produced by the business owner. If copywriting has been factored in the project scope for the design agency, it’s vital that you work with them on what keywords and phrases they should include in the text.</p>
        <h4 class="heading-20">5. Visual elements</h4>
        <p class="articlepara">With the site architecture and some content in place, the visual branding is next in line. If you’ve already defined your branding, good for you! If you’re defining the visual style from the ground up, tools like style tiles, moodboards, and element collages can help with this process.<br><br>This part of the design process will often be shaped by existing branding elements, colour choices, and logos. Images are taking on a more significant role in web design now than ever before. Not only do high-quality images give a website a professional look and feel, they also communicate a message, are mobile-friendly, and help build trust.<br><br>Visual content is known to increase clicks, engagement, and revenue. Images make a page feel less cumbersome and easier to digest, enhance the message in the text, and can even convey vital messages in one glance. We recommend using a professional photographer to get your images instead of stock imagery. Just keep in mind that massive, beautiful images can seriously slow down a site. TinyPng is a great site to compress images without losing quality.</p>
        <h4 class="heading-20">6. Testing Time</h4>
        <p class="articlepara">By now, you&#x27;ve got all your pages and defined how they display to the site visitor, so it&#x27;s time to make sure it all works. Combine manual browsing of the site on a variety of devices and browsers with automated site crawlers to identify everything from user experience issues to simple broken links. <br><br>It would be a good idea to test out the responsiveness of your website at this stage at different device widths: Widescreen monitors, laptops, tablets and mobile devices (portrait and landscape). Errors may be the result of small coding mistakes, and while it is often a pain to find and fix them, it’s better to do it before it goes live.</p>
        <h4 class="heading-20">7. Launch</h4>
        <p class="articlepara">Once everything&#x27;s working beautifully, it&#x27;s time to plan and execute your site launch! This should include planning both launch timing and communication strategies — i.e., when will you launch and how will you let the world know? <br><br>Don’t expect this to go perfectly. There may be still some elements that need fixing. Web design is a fluid and ongoing process that requires constant maintenance. Web design — and really, design in general — is all about finding the right balance between form and function. You need to use the right fonts, colours, and design motifs but the way people navigate and experience your site is just as important.<br><br>A key thing to remember about the launch stage is that it’s nowhere near the end of the job. The beauty of the web is that it’s never finished. Once the site goes live, you can continually run user testing on new content and features, collect user feedback, monitor analytics, and refine your messaging.In the meantime, pat yourself on the back and bask in the digital glory!</p>
