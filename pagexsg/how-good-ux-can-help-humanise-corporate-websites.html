        <p class="articlepara">User experience design for businesses is getting more and more expressive today. Almost every company is fighting for a piece of the online pie. How does design influence your corporate website?<br><br>We worked with a B2B company on their website structure and… the content was all over the place. Some links probably weren’t serving any purpose at all. <br><br>So your business is a B2B one. With this business scheme in mind, define your target audience and nature of interactions first. They will be the key factors for efficient and user-friendly design. <br><br>Here are some must-have elements that should be incorporated in any corporate B2B website:</p>
        <h4 class="heading-20">1. Get CTA elements seen instantly.</h4>
        <p class="articlepara">Call-to-action buttons should be perfectly visible. The price of a click in a B2B page is much higher, as visitors are often horribly busy and don’t tend to spend much time looking for a button on the page. Apply color, shape or orientation contrast, test the most effective placement and think over the copy on it — all these have a crucial effect on conversion rates.</p>
        <h4 class="heading-20">2. Make your value proposition noticeable.</h4>
        <p class="articlepara">Getting to the website, the visitors should immediately understand why that particular page is beneficial to them. Don’t make them search for the reason to cooperate with your B2B service — they won’t do it. Use a catchy slogan or tagline that expresses the value proposition briefly and clearly, and take care of its visual performance. Typographic hierarchy will help the user’s eye to catch it first, while appropriate fonts will add mood and style to the message.</p>
        <h4 class="heading-20">3. Don’t overwhelm users with information: prioritize content.</h4>
        <p class="articlepara">There is a big temptation for a business to show all its strong sides at maximum. However, it may load the website with a huge amount of data which might confuse, annoy or even frighten the visitor. It is especially hard in cases where visual hierarchy isn’t thought-out and tested properly: the pages risk transforming into a mess which cannot be scanned quickly. Apply design techniques and layout which will strengthen the visual performance and appeal of core information.</p>
        <h4 class="heading-20">4. Make copy blocks digestible.</h4>
        <p class="articlepara">The debates around the theme of copy blocks are still hot and actual: Which copy is better, long or short? The decision on the amount of copy has to be based on thorough research and testing as it directly and highly influences conversions. For example, if the webpage presents a well-known company, product or service or informs about special offers, sometimes short and concise copy is enough to encourage users to buy or know more.<br><br>However, if a new or relatively unknown product or service is presented, it may be important to provide users with more information persuading them to follow the call to action. Whatever the decision, the copy content should be given in scannable blocks which aren’t too big so that the user is not overwhelmed and can digest the information quickly. Visually scanning the blocks should allow users to quickly understand the content. This can be achieved if the copy brings useful information and is well organised.</p>
        <h4 class="heading-20">5. Keep core data available from the pre-scroll area.</h4>
        <p class="articlepara">Users usually decide on staying on a website or leaving it very quickly. It is really a matter of minutes or even seconds. That is why all the key information would better be seen in the pre-scroll area, or the Hero section as commonly referred to in the web design community, including the value proposition and ability to contact your business.</p>
        <h4 class="heading-20">6. Consider promo video content.</h4>
        <p class="articlepara">Promo videos are trending in business marketing schemes now as they inform users about the business’ value propositions and benefits in a fast and original way. However, as videos may influence the loading speed of the page, the decision to include one needs to be deliberated with careful assessment.</p>
        <h4 class="heading-20">7. Apply landing pages for special offers.</h4>
        <p class="articlepara">Landing pages focuses the user’s attention on specific information instead of making them search for it around the website. Landing pages have an industry average of increasing leads by 55% and improving their conversions in the double digits. PageXsg strongly recommends our clients to give out some freebies on their landing pages (coupons, e-books, free trials, etc.) to encourage the gathering of information leading to an easier conversion process.</p>
        <h4 class="heading-20">8. Don’t forget about testimonials and signs of trust.</h4>
        <p class="articlepara">Word-of-mouth is the best advertising, especially in the B2B sphere. When making a decision on collaboration, people tend to consider references, testimonials and other signs of trust from previous clients as positive factors. So make sure these validations and endorsements from your satisfied customers are available and easily found.</p>
        <p class="articlepara"><br><br>Hopefully, the strategies mentioned above will help not only SMEs but also entrepreneurs who want to know more about web design issues influencing their business’ profitability.
